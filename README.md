# Project2Revature

This Project is so incomplete it is hilarious.
A key part of the code broke 10 minutes before midnight because I overwrote my Controller from my VS code while I was trying to sync it with my Org. I tried desperately to fix it, but failed. Scratch that, a *lot* of my code was killed because I must have synced the wrong way? Also, I tried to make a repo at the very end, thus I don't have any of my previous versions. A mistake I will never do again.

I did not try to do *any* of the extra assignments because I thought that they were way out of scope. In reality, my project that I wanted to do was way out of scope. I *had* (not anymore because of the breaking) a working API consumer that brought up an image of a card when used. I *had* something that could delete a card from the database (technically filling in the requirements). Instead I spent the entirety of my time adding in a function that ended up not working (for a reason I don't know why, after double, tripple, quadruple checking).

Then Of course I realized I was missing a key part of the assignment: the entirety of the Digital Experience. Or to state it more acurately, I knew I couldn't design a pretty website, so I thought I would just throw my component up on the site and be done, but I couldn't even do that (despite following the step by step documentation).

The one positive thing I can say about the project is I learned a ton.

Anyway, here is the (late, broken, not the correct version, spagetti) code.
