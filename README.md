# Project2Revature

things you need to do:

run the upsert method:
upserter.upsertAll();

make the decks, copies, and card tabs

for some reason modify the real_name__c and faction__c fields to be required (to make them visible)

create some fake decks

future development would be:

Handle all exceptions (what if a row isn't checked onclicked?)
make a (create/delete) deck buttons
make adding cards and removing cards multibutton (right now they are all single button)
Styling the page
